- Input Loop
- Parsing
	- Lexical Analysis/Tokenization
* enum that contains token names
* struct to hold each found token that contains: enum of token name and value of token
* loop over string of text (in our case, a command), separate the tokens:values and put them in an array
	** command [command modifiers] [command inputs]
		ex. grep -i "hello" input.txt > output.txt

Tokens: 
COMMAND = grep,
COMMAND_FLAG = -i,
PARAMETER = input.txt,
OPERATOR = >,
PARAMETER = output.txt

Good shell operations write-up: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/159513/what-are-the-shells-control-and-redirection-operators

* Implement basic tokenization without operators
* Add operator functionality

- Executing standard terminal commands like ls, cd, touch, etc...
- Output/input redirection
