# turtle-shell

## Overview
This project is a simple shell that I built to learn more how shells work.

## Goals

My goals when building this shell were to learn:
- How a shell parses and runs commands on a unix system
- How to handle input/output redirection through pipes
- How to manage processes in C
- Further my understanding of system calles like fork, exec, wait, etc...
